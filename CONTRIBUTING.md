Thanks for your interest in contributing!

- Run tests locally: `pip install -e .[dev]` then `python -m pytest -q`.
- Keep changes small and focused; add tests for bug fixes.
- Follow ruff/mypy checks; CI runs `ruff` and `mypy` automatically.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` as appropriate.

If you need help, open an issue describing the problem and steps to reproduce.
